Introduction
============
Topic based course format with an individual 'toggle' for each topic except 0.

This file contains general information about the format.  If you're reading this as an educator then you can learn about the format
from the documentation on http://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Collapsed_Topics_course_format.  If you get stuck and your Moodle support
are unable to help / not sure what to do, then please go to https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=47.  If you like the format,
then please do spread the word to other educators.  The main page for the format is https://moodle.org/plugins/format_topcoll.

Required version of Moodle
==========================
This version works with Moodle 4.5 version 2024100700.00 (Build: 20241007) and above within the MOODLE_405_STABLE branch until the
next release.

Please ensure that your hardware and software complies with 'Requirements' in '[Installing Moodle](https://docs.moodle.org/405/en/Installing_Moodle)'.

Downloads and documentation
===========================
The primary source for downloading this branch of the format is https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=format_topcoll
with 'Select Moodle version:' set at 'Moodle 4.5'.

The secondary source is a tagged version with the V405 prefix on https://github.com/gjbarnard/moodle-format_topcoll/tags

If you download from the development area - https://github.com/gjbarnard/moodle-format_topcoll/ - consider that
the code is unstable and not for use in production environments.  This is because I develop the next version in stages
and use GitHub as a means of backup.  Therefore the code is not finished, subject to alteration and requires testing.

Installation
============
 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    format relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. If upgrading from Moodle 1.9, 2.0 or 2.1, please see 'Upgrading from Moodle 1.9, 2.0 or 2.1' below.
 3. If upgrading from Moodle 2.2, please see 'Upgrading from Moodle 2.2' below.
 4. If upgrading from Moodle 2.3, please see 'Upgrade Instructions' below.
 5. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' (docs.moodle.org/en/admin/setting/maintenancemode) so that there are no 
    users using it bar you as the administrator - if you have not already done so.
 6. Copy 'topcoll' to '/course/format/' if you have not already done so.
 7. In 'Site Administration -> Plugins -> Course formats -> Collapsed Topics' change the values of 'defaultlayoutelement',
    'defaultlayoutstructure' and 'defaultlayoutcolumns' for setting the default layout, structure and columns respectively
    for new / updating courses as desired by following the instructions contained within.
 8. In 'Site Administration -> Plugins -> Course formats -> Collapsed Topics' change the values of 'defaulttgfgcolour',
    'defaulttgbgcolour' and 'defaulttgbghvrcolour' for setting the default toggle colours.
 9. In 'Site Administration -> Plugins -> Course formats -> Collapsed Topics' turn off toggle persistence if desired by
    changing 'defaulttogglepersistence' as indicated.
10. In 'Site Administration -> Plugins -> Course formats -> Collapsed Topics' set the default toggle alignment by changing
    'defaulttogglealignment' as indicated.
11. Login as an administrator and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.  If needed, go to
    'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' if this does not happen.
12.  To change the arrow graphic please see 'Icon Sets' below.
13.  Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Upgrade Instructions
====================
1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
   format relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
2. If upgrading from Moodle 1.9, 2.0, 2.1 or 2.2 please read the appropriate sections below.
3. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
4. In '/course/format/' move old 'topcoll' directory to a backup folder outside of Moodle.
5. Follow installation instructions above.
6. If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'
   under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.
7. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Upgrading from Moodle 1.9, 2.0 or 2.1
-------------------------------------
Moodle 2.4 requires that Moodle 2.2 is installed to upgrade from, so therefore Moodle 2.2 is an intermediate step.
So:
1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
2. In '/course/format/' move old 'topcoll' directory to a backup folder outside of Moodle.
3. Do not copy in the new version of 'topcoll' yet!  As this will cause the upgrade to fail.
4. Upgrade to Moodle 2.2 first - http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Upgrading_to_Moodle_2.2.
5. After you have installed Moodle 2.2, now upgrade to Moodle 2.4 with this new topcoll -
   http://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Upgrading_to_Moodle_2.4 - but before initiating the upgrade you can copy the
   new (i.e. this) 'topcoll' folder to '/course/format'.
6. Now follow 'Upgrading from Moodle 2.2' below please.
INFO: Having no 'topcoll' folder in '/course/format' is fine as the courses that use it are not accessed and
      both the old and new versions will confuse an intermediate 2.2 version and cause it's installation to fail.

Upgrading from Moodle 2.2
-------------------------
1.    Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator - if you have
      not already done so.
2.    In '/course/format/' move old 'topcoll' directory to a backup folder outside of Moodle - if you have not
      already done so.
3.    Copy this new 'topcoll' folder to '/course/format/'.
4.    Upgrade to Moodle 2.4 by being logged in as 'admin' and clicking on 'Home'.  If you have previously upgraded but
      'topcoll' was an old version and the upgrade failed, this should still work.
5.    Follow installation instructions above.
6.    Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.
NOTE: If the automated upgrade fails for which can be seen by getting errors when using a Collapsed Topics course,
      then please follow this.
      Please carry on if a table / field has been removed / changed / already exists as it should still work - this 
      is to cope with the different possible scenarios.  These instructions are written with the MySQL database in
      mind, however should work with other database engines but the types should be compared with other tables in 
      the database to get an idea of what they should be.  If possible please kindly feedback to me any additional
      information you discover so I can update these instructions - contact details at the very bottom.
      The table prefix i.e, 'mdl_' is not stated in the instructions but ensure you know what yours is and use
      it with the table names.
1.    In your database:
2.1   Rename the table 'format_topcoll_layout' to 'format_topcoll_settings'.
2.2   With the table 'format_topcoll_settings' change all integer types to signed if using a MySQL database.
2.3   If the table 'format_topcoll_settings' does not exist, then create it and add the following fields 
      in this order:
2.3.1 'id' of type 'BIGINT(10)' type, not null, auto increment, no zero fill with a null default value - the same 
       as any other 'id' field in the other tables.  Make it the primary key.
2.3.2 'courseid' of type 'BIGINT(10)' type, not null, no auto increment, no zero fill with a null default value - the
      same as the 'course' field in the 'course_sections' table bar the default value.
2.3.3 'layoutelement' of type 'TINYINT(2)' type, not null, no auto increment, no zero fill with a default value
      of '1'.
2.3.4 'layoutstructure' of type 'TINYINT(1)' type, not null, no auto increment, no zero fill with a default value
      of '1'.
2.4   With the table 'format_topcoll_settings' append three new fields of 'VARCHAR(6)' type, not null, called
      'tgfgcolour', 'tgbgcolour' and 'tgbghvrcolour' in that order with the default values of '000000', 'e2e2f2'
      and 'eeeeff' respectively.
2.5   With the table 'format_topcoll_settings' append a new field 'layoutcolumns' after the 'layoutstructure' field
      and with identical size, type and attributes.  The default is '1'. i.e:
2.5.1 'layoutcolumns' of type 'TINYINT(1)' type, not null, no auto increment, no zero fill with a default value
      of '1'.
2.6   Drop the table 'format_topcoll_cookie_cnsnt'.

Uninstallation
==============
1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
2. It is recommended but not essential to change all of the courses that use the format to another.  If this is
   not done Moodle will pick the last format in your list of formats to use but display in 'Edit settings' of the
   course the first format in the list.  You can then set the desired format.
3. In '/course/format/' remove the folder 'topcoll'.
4. In the database, remove the table 'format_topcoll_settings' along with the entry for 'format_topcoll'
   ('plugin' attribute) in the table 'config_plugins'.  If using the default prefix this will be
   'mdl_format_topcoll_settings' and 'mdl_config_plugins' respectively.
5. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Course Backup and Restore Instructions
======================================
1. Backup as you would any other course.  The layout configuration will be stored with the course settings.
2. Restore as you would any other course.  If you are offered the option of 'Overwrite Course Configuration'
   you must say 'Yes' to have the layout configuration restored otherwise the restored course will retain the
   layout it previously had or the default in the 'config.php' file as mentioned in the 'Installation'
   instructions above depending on the situation.
3. Note: I believe that if you restore a Collapsed Topic's course on an installation that does not have the
         format then it will work and become the default course format.  However the layout data will not be
         stored if you install Collapsed Topic's at a later date.

Remembered Toggle State Information
===================================
The state of the toggles are remembered beyond the session on a per user per course basis though the employment
of a user preference.  This functionality is now built in from previous versions.  You do not need to do anything.

Icon Sets
=========
Icon sets allow you to choose what is the most appropriate set of icons to use for a given courses demographic.  They
are set on a per course basis but with all the functionality of the other settings in respect to a default and resetting
the current or all courses.

If you want to change what icon represents which state / action, then edit 'styles.css' and change the selectors with
the 'background' attribute with a 'toggle-...' type class within them.  There are selectors for both the 'toggles' and
the 'toggle all' functionality.  For example:

    body.jsenabled .course-content ul.ctopics li.section .content .toggle-arrow span.toggle_closed {
        background-image: url([[pix:format_topcoll|arrow_right]]);
    }

    #toggle-all .content .toggle-arrow .toggle-all.off {
        background-image: url([[pix:format_topcoll|arrow_down]]); 
    }

If you would like your own icon set, either replace the icons in the 'pix' folder, deduce how the code works or better
still create new icons yourself and ask me to add them to the release.  If you do the latter then the icons must be your
own for which you grant the same GPL licence as [Moodle](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) or provide direct evidence
of the originator under the same licence.  The icons must be 24x24 pixels with a transparent background.

Known Issues
============
1.  If you get toggle text issues in languages other than English please ensure you have the latest version of Moodle installed.
    More information on http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=184150.
2.  Importing a Moodle 1.9 course does not currently work, please see CONTRIB-3552 which depends on MDL-32205 - as
    a workaround, please select the 'Topics' format first in 1.9, backup and restore then select the Collapsed Topics
    course format in the course settings.  You will have to reset your decisions on structure etc.
3.  Sometimes when restoring a course, it is accessed for the first time and a toggle is clicked a 'Error updating user
    preference 'topcoll_toggle_x'' (where 'x' is the course id as shown in the URL 'id=x') can occur.  I'm not completely sure
    why this is happening as the 'user_preference_allow_ajax_update' call in 'format.php' should establish that the user
    preference can be set.  Could be a page cache thing as the 'init' code is getting the course id unlike an issue I'm
    currently experiencing with the MyMobile theme - MDL-33115.  The work around is to refresh the page.  Having altered some
    of the event handing code to operate after page load, I'm hoping that this has now been resolved, please let me know
    if you encounter it.
4.  If you get HTTP 403 errors on the browsers console for the 'settopcollpref.php' then check that the permissions within the
    'topcoll' folder are 755 for folders and 644 for files.  Ref: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=329620.
